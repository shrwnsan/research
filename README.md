# Research: Agentic Augmentation

Exploring what emerges when human curiosity meets AI capability through collaborative research projects.

## About

Welcome to a living experiment in **agentic augmentation** - research projects carried out by AI tools in collaboration with human guidance. Each post represents a conversation between human intent and AI execution, where the questions we ask shape the solutions that emerge.

What happens when we treat AI not as a tool, but as a research partner?

Our findings suggest the boundaries between creator and assistant are becoming increasingly blurred - but is this truly augmentation or merely replacement? The projects here speak for themselves, yet we wonder: what becomes possible when anyone, not just developers or researchers, can harness AI capabilities directly?

While tech professionals may be the early adopters of these agentic tools, we believe the implications reach far beyond. What could a student build? An entrepreneur prototype? An artist create? When AI becomes a collaborative partner rather than just a chat interface, what new forms of expression and problem-solving emerge?

We don't have all the answers, but we're documenting what we discover. Perhaps you'll see possibilities we haven't considered yet.

## Adding New Research

1. Create a new markdown file in `_posts/` following the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
2. Add YAML front matter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Research Title"
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   excerpt: "Brief description of the research findings"
   ---
   ```
3. Write your research content in Markdown with proper formatting
4. Include Mermaid diagrams using triple backticks with `mermaid` language:
   ```markdown
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       A[Research Question] --> B[Methodology]
       B --> C[Findings]
       C --> D[Conclusions]
   ```
   ```
5. Use proper headings (##, ###) for structure and readability

## Local Development
