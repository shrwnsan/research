# Research: Agentic Augmentation

Exploring what emerges when human curiosity meets AI capability through collaborative research projects.

## About

Welcome to a living experiment in **agentic augmentation** - research projects carried out by AI tools in collaboration with human guidance. Each post represents a conversation between human intent and AI execution, where the questions we ask shape the solutions that emerge.

What happens when we treat AI not as a tool, but as a research partner?

Our findings suggest the boundaries between creator and assistant are becoming increasingly blurred - but is this truly augmentation or merely replacement? The projects here speak for themselves, yet we wonder: what becomes possible when anyone, not just developers or researchers, can harness AI capabilities directly?

While tech professionals may be the early adopters of these agentic tools, we believe the implications reach far beyond. What could a student build? An entrepreneur prototype? An artist create? When AI becomes a collaborative partner rather than just a chat interface, what new forms of expression and problem-solving emerge?

We don't have all the answers, but we're documenting what we discover. Perhaps you'll see possibilities we haven't considered yet.

## Adding New Research

You can add research content either manually or through TinaCMS:

### Method 1: TinaCMS Visual Editor (Recommended)
1. Start the development server (see [Local Development](#local-development))
2. Visit `http://localhost:4000/admin/index.html` to access TinaCMS
3. Use the visual editor to create and edit posts
4. TinaCMS automatically manages YAML front matter and file organization

### Method 2: Manual File Creation
1. Create a new markdown file in `_posts/` following the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
2. Add YAML front matter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Research Title"
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   excerpt: "Brief description of the research findings"
   ---
   ```
3. Write your research content in Markdown with proper formatting
4. Include Mermaid diagrams using triple backticks with `mermaid` language:
   ```markdown
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       A[Research Question] --> B[Methodology]
       B --> C[Findings]
       C --> D[Conclusions]
   ```
   ```
5. Use proper headings (##, ###) for structure and readability

## Local Development

For comprehensive development setup and documentation:

📖 **See [docs/DOCKER-README.md](docs/DOCKER-README.md) for Docker setup**
📖 **See [docs/social-sharing-setup.md](docs/social-sharing-setup.md) for social media configuration**

### Quick Start

#### TinaCMS Development (Recommended)
Choose one of the following TinaCMS development options:

```bash
# Option 1: TinaCMS with Docker (recommended)
bun run tinacms:docker
# Access CMS at: http://localhost:4000/admin/index.html
# GraphQL API: http://localhost:4001/graphql

# Option 2: TinaCMS with local Jekyll
bun run tinacms
# Access CMS at: http://localhost:4000/admin/index.html

# Option 3: TinaCMS with production-like Docker
bun run tinacms:docker-prod
# Access CMS at: http://localhost:4001/admin/index.html
```

#### Traditional Development
```bash
# Docker development (without TinaCMS)
./scripts/dev-start.sh dev
# Visit http://localhost:4000

# Using Ruby Jekyll (without TinaCMS)
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
